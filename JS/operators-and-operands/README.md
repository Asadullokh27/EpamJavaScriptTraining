# Operators and operands

## Tasks

### Amount
Calculate the sum of two numbers
For example:
```js
getSum(5, 3) // result: 8
getSum(-11, 3) // result: -8
getSum(0.2, 0.7) // result: 0.9
```

### Square
You have an integer, define if it's a square number.
For example:
```js
isSquare(9) // result: true (√9=3)
isSquare(8) // result: false
```

### Greeting
Create the function "greeting" which returns a greeting string.
For example:
```js
greeting('Bill', 'Jacobson', 33); // result: Hello, my name is Bill Jacobson and I am 33 years old.
greeting('Jim', 'Power', 11); // result: Hello, my name is Jim Power and I am 11 years old.
```
